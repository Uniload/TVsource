     gameHints(31)="HINT:  When manning a vehicle, a manifest is displayed in your HUD. You can instantly switch to any empty position by pressing the position's corresponding number key."
     gameHints(32)="HINT:  The Fighter is the only vehicle that is not damaged by water. The other vehicles will take continuous damage if they are more than half submerged."

     gameHints(34)="HINT:  The Sniper Rifle has limited ammunition, but it also will use up your entire supply of energy with each shot. The more energy you have available for it to use, the more damage it will inflict."

     gameHints(47)="HINT:  By default, teams are represented in your HUD using relative colors - green is always friendly, red is always enemy. You can change them to absolute team colors by opening the Controls tab of the Options menu."
     gameHints(48)="HINT:  Look for Base Turrets near your bases. There are Mortar, Burner, Sentry and Anti-Aircraft Base Turrets. To function, they must be powered and manned. Enter a turret by walking up to it and pressing '%Use%'."
     gameHints(49)="HINT:  There are five kinds of Deployable: Turret, Mine, Inventory Station, Repairer and Catapult. Think carefully about where you deploy them. A badly placed or unused Deployable is a wasted resource!"
